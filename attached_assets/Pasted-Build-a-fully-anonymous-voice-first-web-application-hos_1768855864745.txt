Build a fully anonymous, voice-first web application hosted on Vercel.

PRODUCT VISION

Create a safe, playful, and emotionally expressive platform where anyone can record and share short audio messages anonymously. The app should feel like a “voice diary for the internet” — raw, human, and judgment-free. No identity, no social pressure, no performance.

CORE CONCEPT

Users can record audio directly in the browser (30–120 seconds).
Audio can be in any language, on any topic.
No signup, no login, no usernames, no profiles.
Every user is represented by a randomly generated cartoon avatar.
Listeners discover voices, not people.
